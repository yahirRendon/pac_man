<h1 align="center">Pac-Man Clone</h1>

<p align="center">
  A  Pac-Man clone built to explore grid-based movement and basic AI behavior. I wanted to better understand how classic arcade logic could be recreated from scratch, so I focused on player controls, pellet collection, and ghost movement using A* pathfinding to simulate chase behavior. While still a simplified version, it helped me experiment with state-driven gameplay, collision detection, and timing-based updates. All within a clean, modular structure.
